VSIM Folder - Contains the images synthesized  with VSIM

	Each sequence folder contains the synthesized images where:
		
		x_italianos_textureQPy1_depthQPy2_z_bad means a synthesized view (with more artifacts) with lateral texture views with QP y1 and lateral depth maps with QP y2, for the frame z
		x_italianos_textureQPy1_depthQPy2_z_good means a synthesized view (with less artifacts) with lateral texture views with QP y1 and lateral depth maps with QP y2, for the frame z
