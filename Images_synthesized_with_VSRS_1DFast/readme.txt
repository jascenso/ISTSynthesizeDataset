VSRS_1dFast Folder - Contains the synthesized images extracted from SIAT

	Each sequence folder contains the synthesized images where:
		
		x_1Dfast_textureQPy1_depthQPy2_z_bad means a synthesized view (with more artifacts) with lateral texture views with QP y1 and lateral depth maps with QP y2, for the frame z
		x_1Dfast_textureQPy1_depthQPy2_z_good means a synthesized view (with less artifacts) with lateral texture views with QP y1 and lateral depth maps with QP y2, for the frame z
